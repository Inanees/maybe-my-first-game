# maybe-my-first-game
I've been planning to start an ambitious project. How about a game? I want to create something on my own.


## Game Ideas
1. Rhythm/beat game. I am fan to this type of game. But it's hard to find a rhythm game that uses local talents and soundtracks with the languages that originates from my country. I know a lot of music and songs from the local scene that would be great to be played on this kind of games. How about I make this game myself?

## Notes
This will be a project/hobby on the side during my free time.
